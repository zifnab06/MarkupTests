## Where's ma device download?
 - Be patient. Devices are slowly being built. If it's not on [http://wiki.lineageos.org/devices.html](this page), it's not officially supported, so will not be built. Do not ask for ETAs. It will build when it's ready
 
## I found a bug. What do I do?
 - Hold ya horses. Does the bug occur on a clean install (eg. Wipe data and try again). If it does, great, you've found a bug. This will soon be able to be reported on [http://jira.lineageos.org](Jira) - the bug reporting system. Wait until then, and do *not* post it on the subreddit as it's own thread
 
## Can I have _xxx_ feature added?
 - No. Well, maybe. At the moment, we're looking to fix bugs and actually work on fixing _major_ features missing. [http://jira.lineageos.org](Jira) will eventually begin taking feature requests, where you can submit your novel idea.

## Are there any bugs?
 - Yes. You'll be able to track them on [http://jira.lineageos.org](Jira)
